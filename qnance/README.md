# Qnance Intro Assignment

## Brief
- This repo has the solution code for the following 2 questions. The code have apt comments added to it for better understanding and the Time Complexity of the solution is also mentioned in the header comment of the 2 codes.
```
1. Implement a function, which takes in a list of strings and return the list of malicious pass-codes present in
the list.
Number of strings: N
Maximum length of a string: L
0 <= N <= 1e5
1 <= L <= 1e3
```

```
3. Given a sorted floating array A of size n, return another array B of size n, such that for every index i, B[i]
= number of elements in A such that every element A[i] <= x < A[i] + 1.
```

### build instructions:
```
cd <project-root> \
mkdir build \
cd build \
cmake .. \

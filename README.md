## Brief:
     Collection of interview coding assignments. The Author strongly **discourages plagarism**. The solutions are implemented in C++ and *tries to conform to [Google C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html)

## Build Instruction:
    This project uses cmake as build files generator & can be build as follows.
    - mkdir <build> //create a build directory to save all the binaries.
    - cd <build> && cmake ..
    - make

- ### [Optiver](https://www.optiver.com/) 
    > An unusually relaxed hackerrank test (with a duration of 48 hrs) comprising of 3 programing questions (easy, medium & hard) and 5 multiple choice questions. The problems had hidden testcases which had to be passed. The test should generally take between 6 to 8 hours to solve.

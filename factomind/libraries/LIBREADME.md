### dlfcn library and it's uses
The `dlfcn` library is a dynamic linking library in C/C++ that provides functions for working with dynamically loaded shared objects (dynamic libraries) at runtime. It allows programs to load shared objects dynamically, retrieve function pointers from the loaded objects, and invoke functions from those objects.

The key functions provided by the `dlfcn` library are:

- `dlopen`: Opens a shared object and returns a handle that can be used for subsequent operations.
- `dlsym`: Retrieves the address of a symbol (function or variable) from a loaded shared object.
- `dlclose`: Closes a previously opened shared object.
- `dlerror`: Retrieves a textual description of the most recent error occurred during dynamic linking operations.

The `dlfcn` library is commonly used in scenarios where dynamic loading of shared objects is required, such as:

- Plugin systems: Applications that support plugins can use `dlfcn` to load and unload plugins at runtime.
- Dynamic module loading: Programs that need to load modules dynamically based on certain conditions or configurations can benefit from `dlfcn`.
- Runtime extensions: Libraries or frameworks that support runtime extensions or scripting languages often use `dlfcn` to load user-provided code dynamically.

Overall, `dlfcn` provides a flexible and powerful mechanism for dynamically loading and using shared objects, enabling runtime extensibility and modularity in C/C++ programs.
